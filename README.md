#Overview
This trading engine implements a limit order book system, which is a core component of electronic trading platforms. It efficiently manages buy and sell orders, maintains price-time priority, and executes trades when orders match.
Key features:

Double-sided order book (buy side and ask side)
FIFO (First In, First Out) matching algorithm
Fast order insertion, deletion, and modification
Trade execution and reporting

#Components
##C++ Implementation

Order: Represents individual buy/sell orders with price, quantity, and type
Limit: Price level that contains a linked list of orders at the same price
OrderBook: Main component that manages the order book structure and matching logic
Trade: Represents matched trades with price, quantity, and timestamp

##Python Implementation

Market: Simulates market data generation with realistic price movements
Ticker: Contains market data like bid/ask prices and volumes
Limit: Manages orders at a specific price level
Order: Individual order representation
OrderBook: Manages the full order book structure with SortedDict for optimal performance


#Key performance optimizations:

C++: Custom linked lists for efficient order management
Python: SortedDict for O(log n) price level access
Both: O(1) order removal and O(1) matching for most cases

#Future Enhancements
##Potential future improvements:

Pro-rata matching algorithm implementation
Market data feed integration
Persistence layer for order storage
Performance benchmarking suite
REST API for order submission
